Tying together comic generation

One topic - define through config file
Replace prompt string with a single topic as input? Move rest of prompt into initial string in context object, use String variable to insert topic from config

Split the topic into panels/talking points using numbered list system
Split the talking points into rhyming pro and con viewpoints
use context to "pass" the prompts back to GPT and modify them until they're in the desired format
maintain the numbered list structure as we modify it, that way it'll maintain its mapping to our java objects

ISSUE: Numbered list check incompatible with multi-line entries
ISSUE: We want XML to be generated dynamically by the AI model (later sprints, maybe leave XML structure to the java code)
	possible approach: use builders to create XML structure, let GPT choose certain key variables (e.g. character poses, text, captions, etc)
